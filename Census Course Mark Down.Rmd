## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



##Loading in the Choroplethr and choroplethrMaps packages to render maps of the Census data
```{r}
library(choroplethr)
library(choroplethrMaps)
```


##constructing a map of US states by population
###The state_chropleth function can map any data as long as the function is fed a data frame with two columns with a col named region and a col named value
```{r}
data("df_pop_state")
state_choropleth(df_pop_state)
```


##Customizing the state choropleth map
###Adding a title and legend to the map 
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_pop_state,
    title = "2012 State Population Estimates",
    legend = "Population")
```


##Creating the same map with a different number of colors
###Looks like choropleth can only handle up to 9 colors
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_pop_state, num_colors = 9)
```
 
 
##Creating a map on a continious scale where outliers will stick out 
### This can be done by setting the number of colors to 1
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_pop_state, num_colors = 1)
```
 
 
 
## Creating a zoomed in map
### You must choose the individual states that you want to use for the visualization
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_pop_state,
                 zoom = c("california", "oregon", "washington"))
```
 


 
 
###Loading in state demographics data
###opening up the dataframe in the viewer
```{r}
data(df_state_demographics)
View(df_state_demographics)
```
 
 
 
###Creating the value column needed to map the data into the choropleth function 
```{r}
df_state_demographics$value =
  df_state_demographics$per_capita_income
```
 
 
 
###Mapping the Per Capita Income Estimates 
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_state_demographics,
                 num_colors = 2,
                 title = "2013 State Per Capita Income Estimates",
                 legend = "Dollars")
```
 
 
 
###Using the Census Bureau's API key to fetch data 
```{r}
df_2010 = get_state_demographics(2010)
View(df_2010)
```
 
 
###Creating a Map out of the data we fetched from the Census Bureau (2010 data) 
```{r}
df_2010$value = df_2010$per_capita_income
state_choropleth(df_2010)
```

###Creating a map of 2015 state demographics
```{r}
df_2015 = get_state_demographics(2015)
df_2015$value = df_2015$per_capita_income

state_choropleth(df_2015)
```

###Creating a percent change data frame
```{r}
df_change = calculate_percent_change(df_2010, df_2015)

View(df_change)
```
 
###Removing unnecessary columns from the percent change data frame 
```{r}
df_change = df_change[, c("region", "value.x","value.y","value")]

View(df_change)
```
 
 
###plotting  percent change of per capita income 
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_change)
```
 
###divergent scale for %change 
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_change, num_colors = 0)
```
 
###Plotting percent change in estimated per-capita income across states 
```{r}
state_choropleth(df_change,
                 num_colors = 0,
                 title = "Percent Change in Estimated Per-Capita Income, 2010-2015",
                 legend = "Percent")
```
 
 
###Looking at the get state demographics function 
```{r}
get_state_demographics #
```
 
###Table for per capita income ending in 2015 spanning 5 years
```{r}
get_acs_data("B19301",
             "state",
             endyear = 2015,
             span = 5)
```
 
###plotting acs survey state income 
```{r}
df_income = get_acs_data("B19301", "state")[[1]]
state_choropleth(df_income)
```


###same table including margin of error (90% confidence that the true per capita income is between estimated value + or - margin of error) The ACS survey which is conducted monthly is a sample and thus has a margin of error associated with it.
```{r}
get_acs_data("B19301",
             "state",
             endyear = 2015,
             span = 5,
             include_moe = TRUE)
```



###US map of counties, shaded by estimated per capita income
```{r}
County_Map_df_income <- get_acs_data("B19301", "county")[[1]]
county_choropleth(County_Map_df_income)
```

###Map of Michigan counties, shaded by estimated per capita income
```{r}
County_Map_df_income <- get_acs_data("B19301", "county")[[1]]
county_choropleth(County_Map_df_income, state_zoom = "michigan")
county_choropleth(County_Map_df_income, num_colors = 1, state_zoom = "michigan")
```

### Choropleth of Michigan, Ohio, Illionois, and Wisconsin. looks the dataframe doesn't need a dedicated state feature in order to filter to specfic states.
```{r}
county_choropleth(County_Map_df_income, state_zoom = c("michigan","ohio","illinois","wisconsin","indiana"))
county_choropleth(County_Map_df_income, num_colors = 1, state_zoom = c("michigan","ohio","illinois","wisconsin","indiana"))
```
